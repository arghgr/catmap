catmap
======

A toy app mapping San Francisco's cats using Ember.js and Google Maps. (and Node.js eventually)

So far, this is a one-page Ember.js app that implements the Google Maps Javascript API V3. It's currently one file so people still learning Ember can see how everything works together. I'll structure the directory further once I set up the backend.

Ember is currently working off of Ember Data fixtures. I plan on replacing that with actual Node.js server calls in the future. For now, there is no data persistence.
