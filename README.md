san francisco cat map
======

A demo app mapping San Francisco's cats using Ember.js and Google Maps. (and Node.js eventually)

To use, just clone it and check out mapedict-emberbatch.html.

So far, this is a one-page Ember.js app that implements the Google Maps Javascript API V3. It's currently one file so people can see how everything works together. I'll structure the directory further once I set up the backend, but I'll keep the original fixtures-only repo in a separate branch.

Ember is currently working off of Ember Data fixtures. I plan on replacing that with actual Node.js server calls in the future. For now, there is no data persistence.

Feel free to make the map your own. Drop me a line if you have any questions or suggestions.
